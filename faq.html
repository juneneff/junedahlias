		<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
		
		<div>
		<section>
		<h2>How is a tuber different from a bulb?</h2>
		<p>Tubers have only a thin layer of skin protecting them and "eyes" where they sprout, much like a potato in both regards. Bulbs, on the other hand, have a thicker skin that acts as insulation and the sprouts come out from between their scale-like layers. They also differ in how they propagate.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section>
		<h2>When should they be planted?</h2>
		<aside>One location I have lived at did not have good soil drainage. We would sometimes have to wait until the end of the window to get the tubers in the ground.</aside>
		<p>Depending on how warm and dry the ground is, they are ready to go into the ground late-April to late-June.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section>
		<h2>How long will they bloom each year?</h2>
		<p>Until the first hard frost.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section>
		<h2>Do they like a lot of sun?</h2>
		<p>They prefer yards with partial sun-exposure during the day but can also do well open spaces with lots of direct sun.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section>
		<h2>How much water do they need?</h2>
		<aside>Tip: If you water during the heat of the day, careful not to get much on the foliage to avoid heat damage. See "<a href="how.html" class="action">how to</a>" for helpful tips about watering.</aside>
		<p>Plant in an area with good soil-drainage and water daily.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section>
		<h2>Can you leave them in the ground over the winter?</h2>
		<aside>Some growers cover their plants with newspaper and/or staw to insulate them while they remain in the ground through the winter.</aside>
		<p>They can be left in the ground during the cold months, provided you have well drained soil and they don't get cold enought to freeze.<p>
		</section>
		
		<section>
		<h2>What if you do choose to pull them out of the ground?</h2>
		<p>Pulling the tuber clumps out of the ground allows you to separate and propagate the plant. Doing this will also help the plant come up stronger once replanted the following year.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section>
		<h2>After digging them up, how do you store them over the winter?</h2>
		<p>There are many different ways to store dahlia tubers over the winter. We store them in open gallon bags and place them in cardboard boxes in a cool, dry area. You may choose to add something like sawdust or vermiculite to the bag as well to help keep moisture from rotting the tubers.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section>
		<h2>Are they picked on by wildlife?</h2>
		<aside>I have had deer come and eat my other plants but have never had them pick on my dahlias</aside>
		<p>When they are small, they need protection from slugs and other bugs.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section>
		<h2>What kind of fertilizer do you use and how often?</h2>
		<p>We use any fertilizer or plant food we are comfortable using on our other plants. Ideally, applications should be made bi-weekly.<p>
		</section>
		
		<section>
		<h2>Are they pet friendly?</h2>
		<p>Yes.</p>
